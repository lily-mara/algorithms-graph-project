The Graphinator
===============

Nate Mara & Evan Baker

Instructions
------------

The Graphinator is written in Python 3 and requires no compile step to be run,
nor does it require any third-party libraries to be installed.

Each line in the input files for the graphinator are expected to have the
following format:

NODE_NAME-NODE_NAME=WEIGHT

Where NODE_NAME's are the names of two nodes in your graph and WEIGHT is the
weight of the edge between the two nodes listed on the line. This is a small
example:

graph.txt

```
e-g=10
a-b=4
a-g=1
```

To start the graphinator, provide the name of your graph file as a command
line argument when starting the graphinator.

```
$ ./graphinator.py graph.txt
```

After this, the menu prompts should direct you through the graph-examining
process!
